SpotifySync (kinda)
===========

Builds and sends a Spotify URL of the current track in Spotify for Mac to your iOS device  (through Apple's Messages app). It's intended purpose is to let you pick up where you left off in Spotify when switching from your Mac to your iOS device.

Before you run this script you will need:

- The latest version of Spotify for Mac installed;
- Messages set up with an iCloud account on both your Mac and iOS device;
- To start a conversation with your own mobile number or iCloud email from Messages on your Mac;
- In the code below replace [Your Phone Number Here] with your mobile number or iCloud email associated with your iOS device.
